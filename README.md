# Introduction
This is a simple chatbot programmed in R, Shiny and SQLite. The intention is to slowly integrate the chatbot with ChatGPT.

# Running the App
1. Setup a local sqlite database by running the script *Database/database.R*. Remember to change the working directory.
2. Run the server.R script with the following command *Rscript App/server.R*
